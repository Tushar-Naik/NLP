1       INSERT - TV COMMERCIAL - DAY                                   1

        Over jungle sound effects, the CAMERA is low, moving
        through brush from the POV of a stalking animal. As the
        brush parts, revealing Wall Street and the New York Stock
        Exchange, we HEAR the resonant voice of GENE HACKMAN.

                                GENE HACKMAN (V.O.)
                  The world of investing can be a
                  jungle.

1A      WE SEE a charging, snorting BULL.                             1A

                                 GENE HACKMAN (V.O.)
                  Bulls.

1B      WE SEE a ferocious, growling BEAR.                            1B

                                 GENE HACKMAN (V.O.)
                  Bears.   Danger at every turn.

        Pretentious CLASSICAL MUSIC kicks in.

                                GENE HACKMAN (V.O.)
                  That's why we at Stratton Oakmont
                  pride ourselves on being the best.

1C-1D   VARIOUS SHOTS -- a conservative young MAN reviews a stock   1C-1D
        portfolio with a wealthy older COUPLE; a smiling young
        WOMAN sits before a computer talking into a headset.

                                GENE HACKMAN (V.O.)
                  Trained professionals to guide you
                  through the financial wilderness.

1E      WE SEE the Stratton "team" - an ethnically diverse group      1E
        of ACTORS with their handsome, grey-templed "CHAIRMAN".

                                GENE HACKMAN (V.O.)
                  Stratton Oakmont. Stabilty.
                  Integrity. Pride.

1F      WE SEE a shot of the black glass Stratton Building, and:      1F


2       INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY   (FEB `95)          2

        Absolute bedlam. 300 drunken STOCKBROKERS, most in their
        early 20s, chant wildly as JORDAN BELFORT, handsome, 30,
        stands beside a DWARF dressed in tights, cape & helmet.
